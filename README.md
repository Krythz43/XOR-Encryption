# XOR-Encryption
A text based encryption which can be used when there is a single shared key

### Usage

Run ```g++ xor.cpp``` and input the required string to get the encrypted string of numbers. Copy them.
On the other end, run ```g++ dexor.cpp``` and paste the string of numbers and experince magic.

### Personal Note
Developed by me in my sophomore year when I was reading about properties of XOR and I realized this could be used to send messages encrypted using a single shared key with my then girlfriend. She is my ex now. Don't mix code and love kids.
